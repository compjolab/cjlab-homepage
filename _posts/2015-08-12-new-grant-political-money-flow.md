> Tracking the flow of money in political campaigns has never been easy. But thanks to a new project in Stanford’s Computational Journalism Lab, it may get easier – and make the world of political money more transparent to ordinary citizens.
> 
> This vision originates in the California Civic Data Coalition, a collaboration between Stanford, the Los Angeles Times, the Center for Investigative Reporting and the San Francisco Chronicle.
