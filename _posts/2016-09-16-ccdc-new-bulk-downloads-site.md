> Today we’re launching an expansion of this site, remaking it as the only destination offering hassle-free access to the bulk data tracking money in California politics.
> 
> Until now, analysts investigating the role of lobbyists and campaign donors at the Sacramento statehouse have been limited to an unwieldy dump from CAL-ACCESS, the jumbled, dirty and difficult database maintained by California’s Secretary of State.
> 
> We’ve built something better. And we’ve got even more in the works.
