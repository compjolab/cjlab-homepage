> Stanford's data-driven journalism program gives students powerful new ways to explore complex stories of public and social significance. The program blends computers and storytelling while upholding the journalistic values of accuracy and relevance.

> There are important stories, Jay Hamilton says, that won't get told unless the research is done.

> "The underexplored area in journalism is big data," said Hamilton, the Hearst Professor of Communication and director of Stanford's journalism program, which this year launched five entirely new "data-driven" journalism courses for both undergraduate and graduate students.
