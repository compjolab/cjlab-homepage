Cheryl Phillips co-authored the "Teaching Data and Computational Journalism" report, published by Columbia Journalism School and The Knight Foundation.
This 88-page book covers the history of data journalism, a survey of data journalism education in higher education today and models for integrating data journalism education into journalism and communication departments. Since the publication of the report, co-author Charles Berret and Phillips have spoken at a variety of conferences and in smaller groups with education leaders to help set the path forward for journalism schools in terms of teaching data journalism.

The book is available in hard copy from the authors and Columbia but also in [__GitBook format__](https://www.gitbook.com/book/columbiajournalism/teaching-data-computational-journalism/details) and as [__a downloadable PDF__](https://journalism.columbia.edu/system/files/content/teaching_data_and_computational_journalism.pdf).
