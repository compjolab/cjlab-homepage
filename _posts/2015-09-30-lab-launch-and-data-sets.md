Thank you to everyone who attended [today's informational session](http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=60a5181e3d9c08e1e0f401dc0&id=1d23daf12f&e=a077356aa8) about the Stanford Computational Journalism Lab. If you weren't able to come by, feel free to sign up for our [mailing list](http://cjlab.stanford.edu/contact#newsletter-section), and/or get in contact with us [via email and social media](http://cjlab.stanford.edu/contact/).

During the presentation, I had a slide listing all the datasets I could think of in 5 minutes that were public, important, "big" (100,000 records or more), and "easy" to get -- at least compared to the days when you had to [send a government agency a shrink-wrapped hard drive](http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/):

Not all the datasets are literally just one-click-to-download -- you may have to [re-read the wget manual](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/26e5922614dc22053745) or write a [quick scraper](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape) -- but they are freely accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. Here's the list of datasets with URLs:


- [Daily pollution readings for every EPA sensor](http://www3.epa.gov/airdata/ad_data.html)

I don't claim that they are easy to _analyze_. As we said during the presentation, computational journalism requires not just technical skill, but in-depth research and investigation of the institutions and processes that produce these datasets. However, even knowing just the existence of this data might inspire project ideas for you.

If you find something interesting, [we'd love to hear from you](/contact). And if studying and doing computational journalism at Stanford interests you, take a look at the [courses we offer in the winter and spring](/initiatives/#courses-section).
