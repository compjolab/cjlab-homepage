Cheryl Phillips, an award-winning journalist with The Seattle Times, will join the Stanford Journalism Program as a Lecturer in the Department of Communication. She will start teaching in fall 2014 and will help develop the opening of the Stanford Computational Journalism Lab.

“Cheryl Phillips brings an outstanding mix of experience in data journalism and investigative work to our program. Students and faculty here are eager to start working with her to push forward the evolving field of computational journalism,” said Jay Hamilton, Hearst Professor of Communication and Director of the Stanford Journalism Program. “Her emphasis on accountability reporting and interest in using data to lower the costs of discovering stories will help our journalism students learn how to uncover stories that currently go untold in public affairs reporting.”

Phillips is Data Innovation Editor for The Seattle Times and a former board president for Investigative Reporters and Editors, a national journalism training organization. In 2011, she helped edit the data visualizations used in the Pulitzer-Prize winning work, Methadone and the Politics of Pain. In 2009, on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, she was the lone editor in the newsroom when a gunman shot and killed four area police officers and then led authorities on a 30-hour manhunt. She played a key role in the coverage by the newspaper, which received a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news. Phillips has been deputy investigations editor and an investigative reporter at the newspaper and has twice been a member of teams that were Pulitzer finalists. She has worked at USA Today and at newspapers in Michigan, Montana and Texas. She has taught data journalism at the University of Washington and data visualization at Seattle University.
