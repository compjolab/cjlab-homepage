Debates about campaign finance laws increasingly center on the question of how to define corruption and influence in politics. The Stanford Department of Communication's 49th Annual Carlos Kelly McClatchy Symposium, entitled "Corruption: Who Plays? Who Pays?," focused on the definition and measurement of corruption in politics as seen through the lens of three fields: legal scholarship, journalism, and political science.

Panelists included Zephyr Teachout, associate professor of law at Fordham University and author of Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin's Snuff Box to Citizens United; Derek Willis, correspondent for the The New York Times; and Justin Grimmer, professor of political science at Stanford. The panel was moderated by Stanford Computational Journalism Lab's James Hamilton.
