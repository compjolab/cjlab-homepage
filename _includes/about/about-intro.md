The Stanford Computational Journalism Lab is working to change the way that stories are discovered and told. We're passionate about supporting accountability and investigative journalism in the digital world. Our ultimate objective: stories that otherwise would go untold will be uncovered by journalists using innovations in computational journalism.

This year, the CJ Lab will involve courses, projects, speakers and research opportunities for Stanford faculty, students and the wider journalism and civic data communities.

We're just getting started and look forward to your involvement in the lab.
