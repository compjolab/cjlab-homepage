### Our Mission
**The Stanford Computational Journalism Lab supports the evolution of computational approaches to public affairs journalism through research, teaching, and the production of reporting.**

&nbsp;

### What We Do
Classes and projects at the CJ Lab focus on two research questions:

**---How do you lower the costs of discovering stories through better use of data and algorithms?** <br>
**---How do you tell stories in more personalized and engaging ways?**

Answering these questions often involves turning unstructured information into structured data for analysis, a challenge pursued by many different parts of the Stanford campus: computer scientists at the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation](http://brown.stanford.edu/); design thinking experts at [the d. school](http://dschool.stanford.edu/); social scientists and digital humanists in the [School of Humanities and Sciences](http://humsci.stanford.edu/); virtual reality researchers in the [Virtual Human Interaction Lab](https://vhil.stanford.edu/); and media professionals teaching in the [Stanford Journalism Program](http://journalism.stanford.edu/). The CJ Lab surfaces problems faced by reporters to those focused on computational approaches to solving analytical challenges.

The ultimate goal of the CJ Lab is to produce students, algorithms and investigations that uncover and reveal stories that currently go untold.
